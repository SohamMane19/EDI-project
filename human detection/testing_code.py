# Use the pre-trained model to detect human poses here

# Analyze the key points to detect seated people

# Make sure to replace the placeholder comments with the appropriate code for loading the pre-trained model and analyzing the detected poses. Adjust the code according to the specific requirements of your project. You can use the pre-trained models available in OpenCV or load your custom pre-trained models for human pose estimation and seated people detection.
